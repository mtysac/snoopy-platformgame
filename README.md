# Platform game with Python

Initially, I made a game for my close friend a while ago but later on decided to use that game's structure and make one as a template for future reference!

### Information

menu.py is the main (the homescreen will appear) but game.py has no homescreen and will jump straight into the game.
The changes made on either file are seperate and is not in sync.

Run editor.py and create your map! (editor.py creates/updates a map.json file.)
Scroll to access different objects.
Hold shift and scroll to access the same object but different type.
Press 'o' to save changes.
